# CostaCodeCraft

Welcome to my digital home! This website serves as both my professional portfolio and a knowledge-sharing hub, focusing on my journey and insights as a backend software engineer.

## About the Project

This website is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized performance out of the box.

## Features

* **Showcase of Backend Expertise:** Explore my projects and experience in backend development.
* **Knowledge Sharing:** Find articles and insights related to backend technologies and best practices.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to run this project locally, here's how:

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone [repository URL]`
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3. **Run the development server:** `npm run dev`
   * This opens the website in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Available Scripts

* `npm run build`: Creates an optimized production build.
* `npm start`: Runs the production build locally.
